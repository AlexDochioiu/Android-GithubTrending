### Project Details
Sample android app displaying a list of popular kotlin github repositories

### Architecture and Tools
* MVVM + Databinding
* RxJava3
* Retrofit2
* Dagger2
* Glide

### Remarks
* Main focus was to write very testable and scalable code, so I treated this project as if I am laying the foundation for a large complex app.
* To show that the code is testable, I included unit tests for a class: `GithubRepoViewModelTest`
